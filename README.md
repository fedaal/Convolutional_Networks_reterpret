# Convolutional_Networks_reterpret
This project aims to reproduce the results of the paper "Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks" by Matthew D. Zeiler and Rob Fergus, and extend their work by applying their visualization technique to the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Task
The task of this project is to implement the visualization technique proposed in the paper "Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks" by Matthew D. Zeiler and Rob Fergus, and apply it to a new dataset, CIFAR-10.

## Data
we used CIFAR-10. It consists of 60,000 color images categorized into 10 different classes.

## Requirements
This project was developed using Google Colab. To run the code, you will need:
* Python 3.6 or later
* PyTorch 1.0 or later
* torchvision
* matplotlib
* numpy
 ```sh
  conda install captum -c pytorch
  ```
